I remember seeing the fires over the ghetto walls and the sky glowed red and black from the fires and smoke.”\\n\\nBut by May 16 the uprising had been crushed. At least 7', '000 Jews died fighting or in hiding in the ghetto', ' while a similar number were captured and deported to concentration camps and extermination centers.\\n\\nAmong them was Vitis-Shomron’s father', ' Simcha Melamed', ' who was trapped within the ghetto.

       "\"The last surviving members of the Warsaw Ghetto resistance have spoken to CNN about the bravery of those who stood up to the Nazis 80 years after World War II's largest Jewish uprising. In 1943, a group of Polish Jews fought back against their German occupiers in what became known as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Though small in number and lacking in resources, the fighters defied the odds, and while the uprising lasted just a month, it is remembered today as a heroic act of Jewish defiance during the Holocaust. The Warsaw Ghetto was established in October 1940 and was the largest Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Europe. About 400,000 Jews were sealed off from the rest of the Polish capital behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. Aliza Vitis-Shomron, one of the last surviving members of the Warsaw Ghetto resistance, spoke to CNN about her involvement with a youth movement within the ghetto and acting as a messenger, warning Jews living there that the Nazis were planning to liquidate. that if I stayed I would not survive and it was more important to her that someone would be left alive to tell the story and because of that I agreed to leave the ghetto', '” said Vitis-Shomron', ' who made a commitment to tell the world what had happened after she escaped with her mother and sister on April 17.\\\\n\\\\nAliza Vitis-Shomron speaks at Yad Vashem in 2013', ' on the 70th anniversary of the uprising.\\\\nAliza Vitis-Shomron speaks at Yad Vashem in 2013', ' on the 70th anniversary of the uprising.\\\\nChanan Tzur\\\\nThe uprising began just two days later', ' after German troops and police stormed the ghetto in an attempt to deport the surviving inhabitants to concentration camps. They were unprepared for the resistance they met from the ghetto’s Jewish inhabitants and the urban revolt lasted for a month.\\\\n\\\\nAbout 700 young Jewish fighters participated in the uprising', ' which also saw the ghetto’s civilian population resist by refusing to assemble at collection points and hiding in underground bunkers.\\\\n\\\\nVitis-Shomron recalled: “The uprising broke out two days later and I was on the other side. I remember seeing the fires over the ghetto walls and the sky glowed red and black from the fires and smoke.”\\\\n\\\\nBut by May 16 the uprising had been crushed. At least 7', '000 Jews died fighting or in hiding in the ghetto', ' while a similar number were captured and deported to concentration camps and extermination centers.\\\\n\\\\nAmong them was Vitis-Shomron’s father', ' Simcha Melamed', ' who was trapped within the ghetto. He was later deported to the Majdanek concentration camp', ' where he was murdered on November 3', ' 1943.\\\\n\\\\nVitis-Shomron', ' her sister and their mother were eventually captured and sent to Bergen-Belsen – where they remained until US forces liberated the camp at the end of the war.\\\\n\\\\nNow aged 95', ' Vitis-Shomron attended the Holocaust Remembrance Day event at Yad Vashem on Monday', ' April 17 2023.\\\\nNow aged 95', ' Vitis-Shomron attended the Holocaust Remembrance Day event at Yad Vashem on Monday', ' April 17 2023.\\\\nChanan Tzur\\\\nA mother', ' grandmother and great-grandmother', ' Vitis-Shomron lives today on Kibbutz Givat Oz in northern Israel.
